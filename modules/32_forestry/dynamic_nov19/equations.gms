*****Costs**********************************************************************

*' The direct costs of Timber production and afforestation `vm_cost_fore` include
*' maintenance and monitoring costs for newly established plantations as well as
*' standing plantations '[@sathaye_ghg_2005]. In addition, this type of forest management
*' (including afforestation) may cause costs in other parts of the model such as costs
*' for technological change [13_tc] or land expansion [39_landconversion]. Also included
*' are additional costs for producing timber from extremely highly managed plantations
*' which are analogous to intensification using technological change from [13_tc] but
*' in a parametrized form.

*****C-PRICE INDUCED AFFORESTATION

*' The interface `vm_cdr_aff` provides the projected CDR of an afforestation
*' activity for a planning horizon of 30 years `s32_planing_horizon` to the [56_ghg_policy] module.

*' The interface `vm_land` provides aggregated forestry land pools (`type32`) to other modules.

 q32_land(j2) ..
 vm_land(j2,"forestry") =e= sum((type32,ac), v32_land(j2,type32,ac));

 q32_aff_pol(j2) ..
 v32_land(j2,"indc","ac0") =e= sum(ct, p32_aff_pol_timestep(ct,j2));

*' The constraint `q32_max_aff` accounts for the allowed maximum global
*' carbon-price induced endogenous afforestation defined in `s32_max_aff_area`.
*' Note that NPI/NDC afforestation policies are not counted towards the
*' maximum defined in `s32_max_aff_area`. Therefore, the right-hand side of the constraint
*' is relaxed by the value of exogenously prescribed afforestation (`p32_aff_togo`).

                =l= s32_max_aff_area + sum(ct, p32_aff_togo(ct));

*****Carbon stocks**************************************************************
*' Forestry above ground carbon stocks are calculated as the product of forestry land (`v32_land`) and the area

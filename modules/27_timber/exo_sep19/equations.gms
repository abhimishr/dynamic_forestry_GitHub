*' The equation above describes production of a MAgPIE timber commodity `vm_prod_timber`
*' as the cluster level production for `vm_prod` for timber. `vm_prod_timber` can be
*' produced from either highly managed plantation foorests or natural forests.
*' The part timber production coming from harvesting of natural forests is calculated
*' in [35_natveg] module.
